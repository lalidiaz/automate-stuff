# automate-stuff with Python üêç

I worked with an excel file and automated the process with Python. 
The file shows 4 columns: Product No, Inventory, Price and Supplier (Company name).

Steps:

1) List each company with respective product count.
2) List products with inventory less than 10.
3) List each company with respective total inventory value.
4) Create a new spreedsheet: Calculate and write inventory value for each product into the spreedsheet (inventory_with_total_value.xlsx file in repo).
